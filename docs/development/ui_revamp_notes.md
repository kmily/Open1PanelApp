# UI Revamp Notes (UI-first, API-parallel)

## Goal
- Prioritize UI restructuring and i18n standardization.
- Keep runtime flows usable even when API clients are under parallel adaptation.
- Record API gaps in `ui_api_gap_review.md` for follow-up.

## Major Changes

### 1) New Application Shell
- Introduced a 4-tab shell architecture:
  - Servers
  - Files
  - Dynamic Verification
  - Settings
- Legacy routes are redirected to the new shell or a legacy redirect page.

### 2) Server Main Flow
- Added card-based server list UI.
- Added modular server detail page with quick actions and module entry grid.
- Kept server config management via local API config storage.

### 3) Files and Settings Refresh
- Rebuilt files and settings pages under the same visual language.
- Files page is intentionally UI-ready with placeholders until file client wiring is complete.
- Settings page now contains theme/language selectors and onboarding reset action.

### 4) Dynamic Verification Page
- Implemented UI flow for MFA loading/binding via repository abstraction.
- Current default uses mock repository to avoid blocking on in-progress API clients.

### 5) Onboarding
- Added 3-step full-screen onboarding page.
- Added coach-mark overlay for first-run key actions on server page.
- Added persistence keys for onboarding/coach completion.

### 6) Internationalization (ARB)
- Added `l10n.yaml` and ARB resources (`app_en.arb`, `app_zh.arb`).
- Migrated new UI flows to generated localization resources.
- Added `BuildContext` l10n extension for clean usage.

### 7) Theme and Tokens
- Added design tokens (`app_design_tokens.dart`).
- Unified Material 3 light/dark themes with consistent shape/spacing behavior.
- Reserved extension points for future iOS-specific visual treatment.

## Important Constraints Kept
- Non-UI historical compile problems were not globally fixed in this round.
- API source-of-truth was constrained to `docs/1PanelOpenAPI/1PanelV2OpenAPI.json`.
- Missing API integrations are isolated behind UI-side abstractions.
